<h2>My Name</h2>
<div class="wrapper">
<p>
I knew my name years before I knew I was a woman, but this story starts even before that. As a young
teenager (I imagine I was 13), I attended an overnight summercamp. The counselors all used camp
names like Meadow or Sunflower in place of what they used in everyday life. At some point my cabin
got the idea to try and guess our counselor's real-life name. After a number of unsuccessful wild
guesses, she gave us the hint that it started with the letter "D". The others in my cabin shouted
out reasonable tries like "Deborah" or "Denice" before running out of ideas and trying unlikely
names like "Demily" or "Drachel". I remember laying in the dark, peeking over the end of the top
bunk I was supposed to be sleeping in, trying to think of a woman's name that started with "D".
</p>
<p>
I've never been an avid viewer of The X-Files, but it eventually occurred to me that the name "Dana"
as in "Dana Scully" is a woman's name, so I gave that a try. Our counselor didn't respond and I
assumed my guess was incorrect. At that point, the cabin descended into chaos, which ended the
guessing for the night.
</p>
<p>
The next day, we begged our counselor to tell us her name because we were all out of ideas. She said
it had been guessed the night before, so I said "Oh, Dana!" and I was right.
</p>
<p>
I thought nothing more of this for years until one day in college. Long before I had any inkling
that my gender identity might not actually align with what I had been assigned, the thought arrived
in my head completely out of the blue that if I were a woman, my name would be Dana. Looking back, I
wish I had interrogated this idea a bit more at the time, but in any case, my reaction was more or
less "huh, that's an interesting thing to think".
</p>
<p>
So I didn't know what that meant, and I wouldn't for many years, but when I did realize I was a
woman (a story for another day, although remarkably similar in some ways), I had the comfort of
already knowing my name, which is Dana.
